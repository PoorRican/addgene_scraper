# Purpose
`addgene_scraper` is a powerful open-source tool designed to aggregate data from the widely recognized AddGene repository.
As synthetic biologists, we understand the importance of having access to high-quality and timely data to enhance your research.
This software enables researchers to download, index, and query AddGene's vast collection of plasmids as a local JSON object.

By creating a local, queryable copy of the database, researchers can increase efficiency in several ways:

- *Offline Access*: Eliminate the dependency on internet connectivity to access critical plasmid information.

- *Tailored Searches*: Run customized, complex queries that may not be supported by the AddGene website's native search functionality.

- *Integration*: Incorporate plasmid data seamlessly into your local bioinformatics workflows and software tools.

- *Reproducibility*: Create snapshots of the database at different time points, useful for maintaining reproducibility in long-term projects.
